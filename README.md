Awalk
=====

by Jono Gould ([TravelGround](http://github.com/TravelGround)), @jonogould

An asynchronous recursive file walker that returns an array of files (filename, path and file size).


## Installation

First, you need to install [node](http://nodejs.org). Then you can continue!

This script runs in terminal.

To get these tools running, you need the following dependencies, available off npm:

- [underscorejs](http://underscorejs.org)

To install this dependency (the easy way), run the following command from the ``` awalk ``` root dir:

``` $ npm install ```

Or place the dependencies there manually but adding them to a ``` node_modules ``` folder

Or add them individually by calling:

``` $ npm install underscore ```

Lastly make the script executable using ```chmod +x awalk.js```


## Usage

How do you use ``` awalk ```, I hear you asking? Well:

- Open terminal
- Navigate to the ``` awalk ``` root dir
- Type ``` ./awalk ``` and press enter
- There are your helpful instructions :D
